v0.3.0 (July 6th, 2015)
-----------------------

This is a minor release, with breaking changes to 0.2.x. Seaborn has updated
its violinplot API, and this is now compatible with ``seaborn`` 0.6.0.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- ``Study.tidy_splicing_with_expression`` now deals with when splicing events
  map to multiple gene names. Fixes #304 with #309.
- Update violinplots to be compatible with ``seaborn`` version 0.6
- Fix masking for ``plot_correlations`` and ``plot_clustermap``
- Fix naming bugs in modality calculations
- Fix ``BaseData.plot_clustermap`` plotting when a threshold is applied and
  introduces NAs. #322

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Rasterize lavalamp plot for visualizing many splicing events at once,
  otherwise the image is too big. PR #308
- Change modality estimation to a two-step process: Estimate :math:`$\Psi~0` and :math:`$\Psi~1`
  first, which change 1 parameter of the Beta distribution at a time,
  then bimodal and middle, which change both parameters of the Beta
  distribution at once
- Remove all "big NMF space" calculations - the user should do them by hand
- Don't plot NMF space with violinplots - make it separate
- Move ``study.py`` from ``flotilla.data_model`` into ``flotilla`` since it's really a controller, not part of the datamodel
