v0.2.3 (November 17th, 2014)
---------------------------

This is a patch release, with non-breaking changes from v0.2.2.

Compute functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Restore :py:func:`.Study.detect_outliers`,
  :py:func:`.Study.interactive_choose_outliers` and
  :py:func:`.Study.interactive_reset_outliers`

Plotting functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add :py:class:`.Study`-level NMF space transitions/positions

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- :py:func:`embark` wouldn't work if `metadata` didn't have a `pooled` column,
  now it does
- :py:func:`.BaseData.drop_outliers` would actually drop samples from the data,
  but we never want to remove data, only mark it as something to be removed so
  all the original data is there
- For all :py:mod:`.compute` submodules, add a check to make sure the input
  data is truly a probability distribution (non-negative, sums to 1)
- :py:func:`.BaseData.plot_feature` now plots all features with the same name
  (e.g. all splicing events within that gene) onto a single `fig` object

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Restore some lost documentation on :py:class:`.BaseData` and
  :py:class:`.Study`

Other
~~~~~

- Rename modalities that couldn't be assigned when `bootstrapped=True` in
  :py:class:`.compute.splicing.Modalities`, from "unassigned" to "ambiguous"
