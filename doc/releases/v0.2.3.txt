v0.2.3 (November 17th, 2014)
---------------------------

This is a patch release, with non-breaking changes from v0.2.2.

Plotting functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add :py:class:`.Study`-level NMF space transitions/positions

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- :py:func:`embark` wouldn't work if `metadata` didn't have a `pooled` column,
  now it does
- :py:func:`.BaseData.drop_outliers` would actually drop samples from the data,
  but we never want to remove data, only mark it as something to be removed so
  all the original data is there

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Restore some lost documentation on :py:class:`.BaseData` and
  :py:class:`.Study`
