v0.2.5 (......)
---------------------------

This is a patch release, with non-breaking changes from v0.2.4.

Plotting functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- New function
  :py:func:`.data_model.Study.plot_expression_vs_inconsistent_splicing()`
  shows the percent
- Add option to :py:func:`.data_model.Study.interactive_pca` to color samples
  by different columns in the metadata.

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- :py:func:`.data_model.Study.plot_classifier` returns a
  :py:func:`.visualize.predict.ClassifierViz` object
- Multi-index columns for data matrices are no longer supported
- Modalities are now calculated using Bayesian methods

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed issue with
  :py:func:`.data_model.Study.tidy_splicing_with_expression` and
  :py:func:`.data_model.Study.filter_splicing_on_expression` which
  had an issue with when the index names are not `"miso_id"` or
  `"sample_id"`.

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add link to PyData NYC talk
- Add scrambled dataset with ~300 samples and both expression and splicing
- Fix build status badge in README
- Removed auto-call to ``%matplotlib inline`` call within
  :py:mod:`flotilla.visualize` because it messes up the ``make lint`` call
  and it's dishonest to the user to be messing with their IPython under the
  hood. It's possible they don't want the plotting to be inline, but rather
  in a separate X-window as specified by their ``$DISPLAY`` environment
  variable.
