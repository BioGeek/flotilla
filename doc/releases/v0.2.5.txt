v0.2.5 (......)
---------------------------

This is a patch release, with non-breaking changes from v0.2.4. This includes
many changes and bugfixes. Upgrading to this version is highly recommended.

Plotting functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- New function
  :py:func:`.data_model.Study.plot_expression_vs_inconsistent_splicing()`
  shows the percent of splicing events in single cells that are inconsistent
  with the pooled samples. Has the option to choose an expression cutoff.
- Add options to :py:func:`.data_model.Study.plot_pca` and
  :py:func:`.data_model.Study.interactive_pca`
  - Keyword argument ``color_samples_by`` will take a column name from the
    ``metadata`` DataFrame, to color samples by different columns in the
    metadata.
  - Keyword argument ``scale_by_variance`` is a boolean which when ``True``
    (default) will scale the :math:`x` and :math:`y` axes by the explained
    variance of their individual principal components (PC1 for :math:`x` and
    PC2 for :math:`y`). If ``False``, then the axes are the same scale, by the
    variance in PC1. Often this will "squish" down the samples in the :math:`y`
    -axis.

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- :py:func:`.data_model.Study.plot_classifier` returns a
  :py:func:`.visualize.predict.ClassifierViz` object
- Multi-index columns for data matrices are no longer supported
- Modalities are now calculated using Bayesian methods
- :py:func:`.data_model.Splicing._subset_and_standardize` now doesn't fill
  ``NA``s with the mean Percent spliced-in/Psi/:math:`\Psi` score for the
  event, but rather replaces ``NA`` with the value 0.5. Then, all values for
  that event are transformed with :math:`\arccos`/:math:`\cos^{-1}`/arc cosine
  so that all values range from :math:`-\pi` to :math:`+\pi` and are centered
  around :math:`0`.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed issue with
  :py:func:`.data_model.Study.tidy_splicing_with_expression` and
  :py:func:`.data_model.Study.filter_splicing_on_expression` which
  had an issue with when the index names are not `"miso_id"` or
  `"sample_id"`.
- Don't cache :py:func:`.data_model.BaseData.feature_renamer_series`, so you
  can change the column used to rename features

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add link to PyData NYC talk
- Add scrambled dataset with ~300 samples and both expression and splicing
- Fix build status badge in README
- Removed auto-call to ``%matplotlib inline`` call within
  :py:mod:`flotilla.visualize` because it messes up the ``make lint`` call
  and it's dishonest to the user to be messing with their IPython under the
  hood. It's possible they don't want the plotting to be inline, but rather
  in a separate X-window as specified by their ``$DISPLAY`` environment
  variable.
- Reformatted all code to pass ``make lint`` and ``make pep8``, and these
  standards will be enforced for all future enhancements.
- Add Gitter chat room badge to README
