v0.2.6 (...)
------------------------

This is a patch release, with non-breaking changes from 0.2.5.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~


Plotting functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed :py:func:`.data_model.Study.save()` to actually save:
    - Gene Ontology Data
    - Minimum number of mapped reads per sample
    - Minimum number of samples to use per feature, at the specified threshold
      (e.g. use features with TPM > 1 in at least 20 cells)


Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Streamlined test suite to test fewer things at a time, which shortened the
  test suite from ~20 minutes to ~3 minutes, about 85% time savings.
- Added requirement for new non-plotting features to at least be documented as
  IPython notebooks, so the knowledge is shared.
