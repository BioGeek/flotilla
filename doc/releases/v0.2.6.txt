v0.2.6 (...)
------------------------

This is a patch release, with non-breaking changes from 0.2.5.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add a :py:class:`.data_model.SupplementalData` data type, which allows the
  user to store any ``pandas.DataFrame`` on the :py:class:`.data_model.Study`
  object as `study.supplemental`. This is essentially user-driven caching.

Plotting functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Changed default loadings plot of PCA to a heatmap of the first 5 PCs

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed :py:func:`.data_model.Study.save()` to actually save:
    - Gene Ontology Data
    - Minimum number of mapped reads per sample
    - Minimum number of samples to use per feature, at the specified threshold
      (e.g. use features with TPM > 1 in at least 20 cells)


Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Streamlined test suite to test fewer things at a time, which shortened the
  test suite from ~20 minutes to ~3 minutes, about 85% time savings.
- Improved accuracy (fewer false positives) in splicing modality estimation
- Added requirement for new non-plotting features to at least be documented as
  IPython notebooks, so the knowledge is shared.
- Changed PCA plot to place legend in "best" place
- Changed default plotting marker from a circle to a randomly chosen symbol
  from a list
- Violinplots are now variable width and expand with the number of samples
    - This was changed in :py:meth:`.data_model.Study.plot_gene`,
    :py:meth:`.data_model.Study.plot_event` and
    :py:meth:`.data_model.Study.plot_pca` when ``plot_violins=True``
- Add info about data type when reporting that a feature was not found
