v0.2.6 (...)
------------------------

This is a patch release, with non-breaking changes from 0.2.5.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add a :py:class:`.data_model.SupplementalData` data type, which allows the
  user to store any ``pandas.DataFrame`` on the :py:class:`.data_model.Study`
  object as `study.supplemental`. This is essentially user-driven caching.

Plotting functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed :py:func:`.data_model.Study.save()` to actually save:
    - Gene Ontology Data
    - Minimum number of mapped reads per sample


Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Streamlined test suite to test fewer things at a time, which shortened the
  test suite from ~20 minutes to ~3 minutes, about 85% time savings.
- Improved accuracy (fewer false positives) in splicing modality estimation
