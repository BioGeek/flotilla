v0.2.0 (November 1st, 2014)
---------------------------

This is a minor release, with some breaking changes from v0.1.1.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Plot the expression or splicing of two *samples* with
  :py:meth:`.Study.plot_two_samples`
- Plot the expression or splicing of two *features* with
  :py:meth:`.Study.plot_two_features`
- Detect outliers with ...
- :py:class:`.Study` doesn't filter out the pooled or outlier samples from the
  data, only technical outliers with fewer reads than specified in the
  argument ``mapping_stats_min_reads``.
- To filter expression or splicing data on the number of samples that must
  detect each feature, you can specify ``expression_thresh``, and
  ``metadata_min_samples`` in the :py:class:`.Study` constructor.

  * For example, if ``expression_thresh=1`` and ``metadata_min_samples=3``,
    then we will only take genes which have expression values greater than
    1 in at least 3 samples. Additionally, we will also take splicing events
    which were detected in at least three cells, since
    ``metadata_min_samples`` applies to *all* data types.

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- The attribute ``data`` in :py:class:`.BaseData` (i.e.
  :py:attr:`.BaseData.data`) now contains **all** the data, including pooled,
  singles, and outliers
- The attribute ``data_original`` in :py:class:`.BaseData` (i.e.
  :py:attr:`.BaseData.data_original`) contains the original, unfiltered
  data. For example, before removing features detected in fewer than 3 samples
  with expression > 1.
- :py:class:`.BaseData` now has the attributes
  :py:attr:`.BaseData.singles`, :py:attr:`.BaseData.pooled`, and
  :py:attr:`.BaseData.outliers` which are on-the-fly subsets of
  :py:attr:`.BaseData.data`. This is to maintain data provenance, meaning if
  "outliers" is changed, this is also changed.
- In :py:class:`.Study`, you now must specify ``expression_feature_rename_col``,
  ``splicing_feature_rename_col``, ``mapping_stats_number_mapped_col``
  explicitly, they are no longer defaulting to,
  ``{splicing,expression}_feature_rename_col="gene_name"`` and
  ``mapping_stats_number_mapped_col="Uniquely mapped reads number"``

Other Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Status messages in :py:func:`embark` have been moved to ``stdout`` instead
  of ``stderr`` to avoid confusion that something is going wrong
- In :py:func:`embark`, user gets notified which samples are removed for having
  too few reads (default minimum number of reads is :math:`5\times 10^5`, or
  half a million reads).
