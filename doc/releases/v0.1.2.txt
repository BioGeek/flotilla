v0.2.0 (November 1st, 2014)
---------------------------

This is a minor release, with some breaking changes from v0.1.1.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Plot the expression or splicing of two *samples* with :func:`study.plot_two_samples`
- Plot the expression or splicing of two *features* with :func:`study.plot_two_features`
- Detect outliers with ...
- :class:`Study` doesn't filter out the pooled or outlier samples from the data, only technical outliers with fewer reads than specified in the  argument ``mapping_stats_min_reads``.
- To filter expression or splicing data

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- The attribute ``data`` in :class:`BaseData` now contains ALL the data, including pooled, singles, and outliers
- The attribute ``data_original`` in :class:`BaseData` contains the original, unfiltered data. For example, before removing features detected in fewer  than 10 samples with expression > 1.
- :class:`BaseData` now has the attributes :func:`BaseData.singles`, :func:`BaseData.pooled`, and :func:`BaseData.outliers` which are on-the-fly subsets of ``BaseData.data``. This is to maintain datameaning if "outliers" is changed, this is also changed.
- In :py:class:`Study`, you now must specify `expression_feature_rename_col`, `splicing_feature_rename_col`, `mapping_stats_number_mapped_col` explicitly, they are no longer defaulting to, `{splicing,expression}_feature_rename_col="gene_name"` and `mapping_stats_number_mapped_col="Uniquely mapped reads number"`

Other Changes
-------------

- Status messages in :py:func:`embark` have been moved to `stdout` instead of `stderr` to avoid confusion that something is going wrong
- In :py:func:`embark`, user gets notified which samples are removed for having too few reads
