Here are instructions to get an active docker image.

1) Install docker ( ≥ version 1.3) according to the instructions appropriate for your system. (https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation).
	Note: On Mac OS X and Windows you will need to start docker through the “boot2docker” application.

Then, obtain the flotilla image with:

sudo docker pull mlovci/flotilla

Then start flotilla with:

sudo docker run -it -v ${HOME}/flotilla_projects:/root/flotilla_projects -v ${HOME}/flotilla_notebooks:/root/ipython mlovci/flotilla

This command will cross-mount directories on your computer to a location available for reading and writing inside the virtual machine. Any analysis you perform will be output to ${HOME}/flotilla_notebooks and the data flotilla requires will be saved in ${HOME}/flotilla_projects.
