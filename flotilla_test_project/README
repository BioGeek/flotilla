barebones_project
=================

install with

    pip install -e .

This installs in "development mode" this will make link to the data, not copy the data to site-packages.
This seems more appropriate.

Also, any changes made in this directory will be immediately reflected in the
import of packages.

How to create a new project
===========================

Goal: `barebones_project/__init__.py` must create one or more of the `pandas
.DataFrame`s. All of these have samples as the row names (`index` in `pandas`
 parlance) and the other dimension as the columns.

* `expression`: RPKM/TPM expression scores (@mlovci: logged or no?)
* `splicing`: Psi splicing scores (between 0 and 1)
* `sample_metadata`: Celltype and other information (e.g. the plotting
"marker" or "color")
* `expression_metadata`:
* `splicing_metadata`: Splicing event name to gene names and Ensembl IDs
* `spikein`: Expression of just the spikeins
* `splice_junction`: Splice junction and `psi` scores from STAR's `SJ.out
.tab` files

1. Add your expression and splicing files to `barebones_project/study_data`
2. Edit `barebones_project/params.py` to have `expression_filename` and
such to use the names of the files you just added
3. Edit `barebones_project/__init__.py` to load your files into pandas
dataframes
    1. Optional: add a `loaders.py` file for more complicated loading
